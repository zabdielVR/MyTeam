- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @zabdielVR and this prototype project is called MyTeam tool development

- ðŸ‘€ This project provides a solution to portfolio projects to facilitate the different core layers of the business to administration, sales and IT

- ðŸŒ± In this section you can see the objectives of this project...

  Agile Development
   
   ðŸ’¬ This project implements Scaled Agile Framework for agile development:
  ðŸ’Ž CALMR approach to agile development
  Culture: The cultural shift is huge when it comes to Scaled Agile. Feedback should be provided on a constant basis, confirming that the features being     built match the needs. Create a shared responsibility for development across the entire team. The culture remains positive because the entire team is       committed to the final product.

- Automation: Difficult to quickly deliver high-quality products if you don't have automation to run tests and move code.

- Lean Flow â€“ Small batch size to drive production faster and create more visibility into the process.

- Measure: Measure each step in the process to ensure that what is being built is achieving the established goals and benchmarks.

- Recovery: Easier to recover because you take less risk by releasing in small batches and implementing automated tests.
