### - Agile Development

- ðŸ’Ž CALMR approach to agile development
- Culture: The cultural shift is huge when it comes to Scaled Agile. Feedback should be provided on a constant basis, confirming that the features being     built match the needs. Create a shared responsibility for development across the entire team. The culture remains positive because the entire team is       committed to the final product.

- Automation: Difficult to quickly deliver high-quality products if you don't have automation to run tests and move code.

- Lean Flow â€“ Small batch size to drive production faster and create more visibility into the process.
